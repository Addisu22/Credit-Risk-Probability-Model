Task 1 - Understanding Credit Risk
==================================

Credit Scoring Business Understanding
------------------------------------
1. How does the Basel II Accord’s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?
The Basel II Accord stresses accurate measurement of credit risk to ensure banks hold sufficient capital against potential losses. This regulatory focus demands models that are transparent, interpretable, and well-documented to provide clear explanations of how risk scores are calculated. Interpretable models help regulators understand the model logic and assumptions, facilitate validation and auditing, and build trust with stakeholders. Without interpretability, complex models may be rejected or require extensive validation efforts, delaying deployment and increasing compliance costs.

2. Since we lack a direct "default" label, why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the potential business risks of making predictions based on this proxy?
In the absence of explicit default data, proxy variables (such as late payments, loan write-offs, or delinquency flags) serve as stand-ins to approximate credit default. Creating a proxy enables model training and risk estimation but introduces risks including bias and misclassification. The proxy may not fully capture the true default behavior, leading to inaccurate risk scores. This can cause poor credit decisions—either extending credit to risky customers (increasing losses) or denying credit to good customers (reducing business). Hence, it is crucial to carefully design and validate the proxy variable to minimize these business risks.

3. What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model (like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence) versus a complex, high-performance model (like Gradient Boosting) in a regulated financial context?
Simple, interpretable models like logistic regression with Weight of Evidence encoding offer transparency, easier regulatory approval, and straightforward monitoring. They support explainability, helping analysts and regulators understand model drivers and behavior. However, they may have lower predictive power compared to complex models.

Complex models like gradient boosting often provide higher accuracy by capturing nonlinearities and interactions but are harder to interpret and explain. This can lead to challenges in regulatory acceptance and require more rigorous validation. In regulated contexts, the trade-off balances model performance with explainability, governance requirements, and the ability to detect biases and ensure fairness. Often, a hybrid approach or explainability tools are used to bridge this gap.
