Task 1 - Business Understanding: Credit Scoring
===============================================
1. Why Basel II Requires an Interpretable and Documented Model
   -----------------------------------------------------------
Basel II emphasizes risk-based capital adequacy, encouraging banks to use internal models for credit risk measurement. These models must be:

Transparent: Easily understood by risk officers and regulators.

Justifiable: Clearly explain predictions and features.

Auditable: Reproducible with well-documented processes. 

Thus, models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) are preferred due to their interpretability, especially in regulated environments.
2. Why a Proxy Default Variable Is Needed (and Its Risks)
   -------------------------------------------------------
In many real-world scenarios, a direct "default" label isn’t available. A proxy variable like "90+ days past due" or "loan written off" is used as a substitute.

Necessity:

Enables supervised learning on historical data.

Allows model training without labeled default outcomes.

Risks:

Bias: The proxy might not generalize across customer types.

Misalignment: Proxy definitions may not reflect true business risk.

False positives/negatives: Can lead to bad lending decisions or rejection of good customers.

Hence, business and data teams must collaboratively define and validate the proxy.
3. Trade-Off: Interpretable vs. Complex Models
   -------------------------------------------
Aspect	Interpretable (e.g., Logistic + WoE)	Complex (e.g., XGBoost, GBM)
Explainability	✅ High	⚠️ Low (black-box)
Regulatory Approval	✅ Easier	⚠️ Slower due to complexity
Performance	⚠️ Moderate	✅ Often higher
Monitoring & Debugging	✅ Simple	⚠️ Complex to trace issues

In regulated credit environments, simplicity often wins unless complex models are well-documented and explainable (via SHAP, LIME, etc.).
